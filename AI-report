This project used OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 for:

1. Fixing import/export and file structure issues
2. Implementing light/dark theme toggle using custom components
3. Designing chart structure (Recharts) in dashboard
4. Writing correct `next.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` for route aliasing
5. Resolving Render deployment issues and setting base path to `/dashboard`

All final code was reviewed and tested by the developer (Dhruv Vaidya).
